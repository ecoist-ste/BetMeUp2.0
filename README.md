# BetMeUp2.0 (GT iOS Hackathon Fall 2024 2nd Place) 
# Inspiration
My friend Max told me that he betted with his friend on his friend being able to find a girlfriend in a semester with 100 dollars at stake. And I feel like friends make bets all the time. So why not just make a wager app where you can make a bet on everything with virtual money?

# What it does
- Create bets on everything
- Use virtual money to place bets
- See other people's bets and join if you like
- Leaderboard shows everybody's bets history and current virtual money amount ## How we built it SwiftUI ## Challenges we ran into Ran out of time to finish backend and some features we wanted to implement ## Accomplishments that we're proud of We used Path and Shape to draw some pesudo 3d objects in Swift and that's so cool! ## What we learned Pressure galvanized us to be productive.

# What's next for BetMeUp
Finish backend
Finish features we haven't had a chance to implement like allowing friends to create friend-group specific wager and let leaderboard show everybody's bet history.
